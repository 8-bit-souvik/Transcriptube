"Hi, I'm Cia from Trans voice lessons dot com and in this video, I want to show you how I turn this voice into this voice. Okay? Take me two years, but I'm gonna tell you in one minute. If you do go these things, you'll be able to yell. You'll be able to cop. It doesn't matter because we're changing the instrument, not our behavior. Okay? So one. The first thing we i have to deal with is pitch. Pitch is pretty obvious. In fact, I think everyone is spending too much time focusing on pitch. I can actually I can actually pass and sound like a girl at a low pitch or I can sound like a boy a hot. It doesn't matter. Pitch is not that big of a video. Okay, two. The next thing that we have to deal with is Larynx height. Okay so let me just demonstrate the sound. So a low like this of start erase except start to raise the lyric up. Okay, that's a huge deal. The lyric height is super important. Three. Engaging the As. So the A when it's engaged. It sounds like this. We need to bring some of that into our sound. Okay? Four. Valve formation so your becomes your becomes your air becomes your becomes e, your e becomes e right? So we have to shift all of our wells brighter. Five. So constant information. We're going to change the and where we actually form our s's our C are p, etcetera. And when you combine all those things together, you can go you can do it whatever you what! In a girl voice? It really doesn't matter. So, yeah, I'm From Trans voice lessons. If you want to work together, please just message me or if you have any questions post below in the comments whatever.
